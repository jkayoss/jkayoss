### About me

I'm also a student of Industrial Engineering, not about development, but should be, right? 

- **Courses** - Finished "Responsive Web Design" by freeCodeCamp and "Advanced UI Design" by Origamid". Actually studying "Complete Javascript ES6" course also by Origamid.
- My [Portfolio](https://jhonatankayo.tech) 💻 - Working on it, developed with ReactJS.
